a
term
of
abuse
first
used
against
early
working
class
radicals
including
the
diggers
of
the
english
revolution
and
the
sans

of
the
french
revolution
whilst
the
term
is
still
used
in
a
pejorative
way
to
describe
any
act
that
used
violent
means
to
destroy
the
american

children

cuddling
without
reciprocating

resist
attention
altogether
later
they
seldom
seek
comfort
from

of
the
word
artistic
works
have
existed
for
almost
as
long
as
humankind
from
early
pre
historic
art
to
contemporary
art
the
creative
arts
are
a
collection
of
disciplines
whose
principal
purpose
is
in
the
output
of
material
that
is
compelled
by
a
personal
drive
originality
in
stylistic
approach
or
a
combination
of
these
two
for
example
a
common
contemporary
criticism
of
some
modern
painting
occurs
along
the
lines
of
objecting
to
the
apparent
lack
of
skill
or
ability
required
in
the
production
of
the
artistic
object
one
might
take

s
my

arguments
usually
proceed
from
one
of
several
possible
perspectives
art
may
be
defined
by
the
intention
of
the
artist
as
in
the
writings
of
dewey
art
may
be
seen
as
being
in
the
response
emotion
of
the
viewer
as
tolstoy
claims
in
danto
s
view
it
can
be
defined
as
perspective
art
is
a
way
of
passing
ideas
and
concepts
on
to
later
generations
in
a
somewhat
universal
language
the
interpretation
of
this
language
is
very
dependent
upon
the
observer
s
perspective
and
context
and
it
might
be
argued
that
the
very
subjectivity
of
art
demonstrates
its
importance
in
providing
films
where
boys
are
generally
voiced
by
women

symbol
used

anarcho
capitalism
aka
free
market
anarchism
is
a
philosophy
based
on
the
idea
of
individual
sovereignty
and
a
prohibition
against
initiatory
coercion
and
fraud
it
in
such
places
and
goods
can
be
acquired
only
by
means
of
a
voluntary
contractual
transfer
of
its
property
title
from
a
previous
to
a
later
owner
this
is
the
root
of
anarcho
capitalist
property
rights
and
where
they
differ
from
collectivist
forms
of
anarchism
original
appropriation
allows
an
individual
property
relations
while
others
believe
exile
or
forced
restitution
are
sufficient
the
use
of
force
many
anarcho
capitalists
admire
the
american
revolution
and
believe
it
is
the
only
u
s
war
that
can
be
justified
the
axiom
of
nonaggression
is
not
necessarily
a
pacifist
doctrine
it

a
prohibition
against

economic
plutocracy

movement

some
while
accepting
that
anarcho

is

question
the
coherence
of
such
a
statement
holding
that
if
marshall
believes
that
anarcho
capitalists
selectively
interpret
individualist
anarchists
texts
overlooking
egalitarian
implications
however
marshall
may
have
overlooked
that
the
most
noted
individualist
anarchist
benjamin
tucker
explicitly
supports
the
right
to
inequality
in
wealth
and
upholds
it
as
the
natural
result
of
liberty
tucker
did
although
oppose
vast
concentrations
of
they
disbelieve
in
punishment
of
crime
and
resistance
to
aggression
but
because
they
disbelieve
in
compulsory
protection
protection
and
taxation
without
consent
is
itself
invasion
hence
anarchism

released

on
a

method
of

antihydrogen
the
technique
involves
slowing
antiprotons
using
the
antiproton
decelerator
and
injecting
them
into
a
penning
trap
specifically
a
penning
malmberg
trap
once
trapped
the
antiprotons
are

known
methods

also
produce

an
interesting
element
of
anchor
jargon
is
the
term
under
weigh
which
describes
the
anchor
when
it
is
hanging
on
the
rope
not
on
the
bottom
this
is
linked
to
the
term
to
weigh
anchor
meaning
to
lift
the
anchor
from
the
sea
bed
allowing
the
ship
or
boat
is
moving
while
dropping
the
anchor
it
may
kite
or
skate
over
the
bottom
due
to
the
large
fluke
area
acting
as
a
sail
or
wing
once
set
the
anchor
tends
to
break
out
and
reset
when
the
direction
of
force
changes
dramatically
such
as
with
the
changing
tide
and
the
holding
power
of
this
anchor
is
at
best
about
twice
its
weight
unless
it
becomes
buried
when
it
can
be
as
much
as
ten
times

weight

are
available
in
sizes
from
about

up

this
is

anchor
which
relies
solely
additional
hazards
not
noted
on
the
chart
which
make
a
planned
location
undesirable
if
the
location
is
good
the
location
to
drop
the
anchor
should
be
approached
from
down
wind
or
down
current
whichever
is
stronger
as
the
chosen
spot
is
approached
the
vessel
should
be

is
often
referred

there
is
also
the
tradition
that
satan
refused

bow
to
adam
as
a
result
of
his
exclusive
love
of
god
and
felt
that
bowing
to
humankind
was

some

debate
since
lennon
was
primarily
an
entertainer
not
a
political
figure
and
it
could
be
argued
that
describing
his
killing
as
an
assassination
is
no
more
appropriate
than
for
example
using
the
term
to
describe
the
murders
of
singers
selena
quintanilla
or
marvin

not

that

there
is

such

will
be
treated
as
not

also

posthumously

techniques
it
is
entirely
likely
that
the
first
strategy
used
by
a
political
or
religious
killer
was
a
remarkably
simple
one
find
the
leader
and
stab
or
bludgeon
them
to
death
with
whatever
weapons
were
available
this
would
likely
have
occurred
only
in

assassinations
both
then

are
most
often
effective

support
tacit

recognize

from

the

about

point
out

the

criticism

communist
revolution
was
inevitable
throughout
europe
numerous
aristocrats
and
conservative
intellectuals
as
well
as
capitalists
and
industrialists
lent
their
support
to
fascist
movements
in
their
countries
which
arose
in
emulation
of
italian
fascism
while
in
germany
numerous
right

nationalist
groups
arose
particularly
out
of
the
post

freikorps
which
meaningful
sense
nevertheless
there
is
some
hostility
toward
china
particularly
among
conservative

which
can
be
regarded
as

introduction
baseball
is
among

popular
team
sports
in
the
united
states
a
unique
culture
surrounds
it
which
includes
the
game
itself
the
field
the
players
the
ballparks
and
the
fans
it
remains
a
sport
created
in
and
for
simpler
times
yet
the
pitcher
responds
to
a
given
situation
each
pitch
begins
a
new
play
which
might
consist
of
nothing
more
than
the
pitch
itself
each
half
inning
the
goal
of
the
defending
team
is
to
get
three
members
of
the
other
team
out
a
player
who
is
out
must
leave
the
for
the
first
baseman
in
bunt
situations
he
she
also
is
a
cut
off
for
the
outfield
this
is
when
the
outfielder
doesn
t
have
to
throw
the
full
distance
from
him
her
to
the
base
but
just
to
the
cut
off
the
shortstop
fills
the
critical
gap
between

batter
off
balance
there
are
exceptions
walter
johnson
who
threw
one
of
the
fastest
fast
balls
in
the
history
of
the
game
threw
sidearm
though
not
submarine
rather
than
a
normal
overhand
fielding
strategy
since
only
the
pitcher
s
and
catcher
s
locations
are
fixed
the
other
players
on
the
he
is
charged
with
an
additional
strike
except
when
there
are
already
two
strikes
thus
a
foul
ball
with
two
strikes
leaves
the
count
unchanged
however
a
noted
exception
to
this
rule
is
that
a
ball
bunted
foul
with
two
strikes
always
counts
as
a
strike
if
a
pitch
is
position
on
or
near
the
plate
and
the
runner
will
often
try
to
knock
the
ball
out
of
the
catchers
hand
since
the
catcher
is
seen
symbolically
and
literally
as
the
last
line
of
defense

the

philosophy
and
a
commentator
on

whom
he
viewed
as
a
successor
who
would
continue

work

logic
he
spent
hours
dealing
with
wittgenstein
s
various
phobias
and
his
frequent
bouts
of
despair
the
latter
was
often
a
drain
on
russell
s
energy
but
he
continued
to
be
fascinated

him

increasingly
vocal
about

bertrand

published
his
three

he
called

is
explicated

gave

in

russell
sets
forth
his
concept
of
an
ideal
isomorphic
language
one
that
would
mirror
the
world
whereby
our
knowledge
can
be
reduced
published
but
their
original
plan
to
incorporate
geometry
in
a
fourth
volume
was
never
realised
and
russell
never
felt
up
to
improving
the
original
works
though
he
referenced
new
developments
and
problems
in
his
preface
to
the
second
edition
upon
completing
the
principia
three
volumes
of
extraordinarily
abstract
and
complex
were
promoting
a
kind
of
mysticism
russell
s
belief
that
there
is
more
to
philosophy
and
knowing
the
world
than
simply
understanding
how
we
use
language
has
regained
prominence
in
philosophy
and
eclipsed
wittgenstein
s
language
centric
views
philosophy
of
science
russell
frequently
claimed
that
he
was
more
convinced
of
to
think
of
russell
as
superficial

glib

message
concerning
repentance
in
preparation
for
the
coming
of
the
messiah
he
john
went
into
all
the
country
around
the
jordan
preaching
a
baptism
of
repentance
for
the
forgiveness
of
sins
as
burial
and
resurrection
but
an
actual
supernatural
transformation
one
that
draws
parallels
to
the
experience
of
noah
and
the
passage
of
the
israelites
through
the
red
sea
divided
by
moses
thus
baptism
is
literally
and
symbolically
not
only
cleansing
but
also
dying
and
rising
again
with
christ
catholics
believe
that
however
where
another
denomination
has
a
somewhat
different
somewhat
similar
theology
of
baptism
it
can
be
difficult
to
be
sure
whether
the
requirement
of
intention
is
met
this
is
why
conditional
baptisms
are
often
performed
in
these
cases
some
conditions
expressly
do
not
affect
validity
fpr
example
whether
immersion
infusion
basis
of
repentance
and
new
life
for
those
who
have
professed
belief
in
him
symbolizing
spiritual
death
with
regard
to
sin
and
a
new
life
of
faith
in
god
they
typically
teach
that
baptism
does
not
accomplish
anything
in
itself
but
is
an
outward
sign
or
testimony
a
personal
act
of
the
sacrament
every
sunday
which
latter
day
saints
consider
to
be
a
renewal
of
one
s
baptismal
covenant
with
god
they
also
believe
that
baptism
is
symbolic
both
of
jesus
s
death
burial
and
resurrection
and
of
the
death
and
burial
of
the
natural
or
sinful
man
and

of

a

in

saint
fashion
the
ordinance
is
performed
only
in

the
prayer
accompanying
the
baptism
differs
from

in
that
it
states
that
the
baptism
must
have
been
a
significant
group
of
people
practicing
it
accompanied
by
opposition
to
it
by
the
church

others
disagree
with
the
classification
of
such
groups
as
orthodox
since
the
councils
concluded
that
they
were
in

unorthodox

and
orthodox

still
assert
this

the
consensus
of

is
that
archaeology
and
textual
analysis
argue

considerably
later
date
this

overview
of

the
book
of
obadiah
is
found
in
both
the
hebrew
bible
and
the
old
testament
of
the
christian
bible
where
it
is
the
shortest
book
its
authorship
is
generally
attributed
to
a
person
named
obadiah
which
date
of
the
prophecy
which
is
discussed
above
there
is
also
discussion
surrounding
verse

says
that
once
judgment
has
been
carried
out
there
will
be
no

the
story
of

setting

a
plot

themes
it
also
relies
heavily
on
such
literary
devices
as
irony

the
story
of

set
against
the
historical

his
people
repent

however
recent

in
many
ways
the
black
death
improved
the
situation
of
surviving
peasants
in
western
europe
because
of
the
shortage
of
labor
they
were
in
more
demand
and
had
more
power
and
because
of
the
reduced

there
was

available
however
the

this

the

the

of

is
an

of

in

mainly

an

require
more
than
the
amendment
proposed
being
passed
by

it
will
require

approval
sometimes
the
reason
for
this
is
that
the

is
considered
supreme

as
according

the

that

for

progressive
creationism
the
view
that
species
have
changed

in
a
process
continuously
guided
by
god
with
various
ideas
as
to
how
the
process
operates
often
leaving
not
mandate
the
concept
of
special
creation
it
says
nothing
about
the
mechanism
by
which
any
thing
was
created
although
phrased
differently
this
doctrine
of
creation
is
common
in
many
branches
of
other
religions
the
strictness
to
which
adherents
are
required
to
accept
these
views
and
the
sense
in
which
predictions
cannot
invalidate
creationism
because
creationism
itself
is
a
belief
and
not
a
scientific
theory
the
belief
can
persist
in
spite
of
evidence
to
the
contrary
there
is
a
fundamental
difference
between
the
scientific
approach
and
the
approach
used
by
creationist
advocates
the
scientific
approach
uses
the
scientific
method
as
to
understand
the
world
to
understand
the
laws
of
gravity
as
well
as
evolution

relying

there

it

as
discussed

more
etymology
the
word
capital
has
roots
in
the
trade
and
ownership
of
animals
the
latin
root
of
the
word
is
capitalis
from
the
proto
indo
european
monarch
loans
the
land
to
vassals
in
exchange
for
various
services
and
the
vassals
in
turn
use
serfs
to
work
the
land
capitalism
contrasts
with
socialism
where
the
means
of
production
are
owned
and
run
by
popular
collectives
such
as
the
state
for
the
people
it
contrasts
with
communism
where
integration
of
property
rules
and
property
information
in
the
country
as
a
whole
d
increased
trust
arising
from
a
greater
certainty
of
punishment
for
cheating
in
economic
transactions
e
more
formal
and
complex
written
statements
of
ownership
that
permitted
the
easier
assumption
of
shared
risk
and
ownership
in
companies
and
a
person
who
has
capital
rather
than
a
person
who
favors
capitalism
and
are
sold
by
the
workers
on
behalf
of
the
capitalist
or
by
the
capitalist
himself
the
money
from
sales
also
becomes
the
property
of
the
capitalist
the
capitalist
pays
the
workers
a
portion
of
this
profit
for
a
free
market
consists
of
voluntary
trade
without
interventionist
regulation
prices
for
example
are
determined
by
trade
rather
than
by
government
in
regard
to
pricing
of
goods
and
services
in
a
free
market
rather
than
this
being
ordained
by
government
it
is
determined
by
trades
that
occur
as
a
result
government
overrides
decisions
of
individuals
pursuing
their
own
ends
however
in
all
large
scale
modern
economies
the
state
conducts
a
degree
of
centralized
economic
planning
using
such
tools
as
allowing
the
country

central
bank
to
set

rates
ostensibly
as
an

attenuate

may
be
socialist
it
works
in
relation
to

much
larger
overarching

world
economy
mainstream
economists
for
their
part
admit
that
the
present
economic
systems
have
diverged
from
earlier
forms
labeled
capitalism

many
believe
that
some
of

lewis
loved
to
read
and
as
his
father
s
house
was
filled
with
books
he
felt
that
finding
a
book
he
had
not
read
was
as
easy
as
finding
a
blade
of
grass
he
also
had
a
mortal
fear
of
spiders
and
insects
as
a
to
leave
ireland
throughout
his
life
he
sought
out
the
company
of
his
fellow
irish
living
in
england
and
visited
ireland
regularly
he
called
this
my

early
in
his

lewis
considered
sending
his
work
to
the
major
dublin
publishers
in
a

to
a

he
wrote
and
irish
fairy

lewis
reportedly
based
his
depiction
of

in
the
novels
on
the
geography
and
scenery
of
the

in

confucius
was
concerned
with

development
which
he
maintained
took
place
within
the

ritual
and

are
the
ways
in
which

should
act

it
produced
became
an
effective
counter
to
the
remaining

then

been
used

includes

in
its

formulation
gives
a
comprehensive
explanation
of

moreover

in

culture
are
not

exclusive
entities

is
free
to
find
its
specific
niche
its
autumn
period
the
classic
period
of
chinese
philosophy
began
it
is
an
interesting
fact
that
this
date
nearly
coincides
with
the
emergence
of
the
first
greek
philosophers
this
is
known
as
the

of
the
many
schools
founded
at
this
time
and
during
the
subsequent
close

mansion
of

he
was
born
into
a
once
noble
family
who
had
recently
fled
from
the

the
records
of
the
grand
historian
compiled
some
four
zero
zero
years
later
indicate
that
confucius
was
conceived
out
of
wedlock
his
father
was

confucius
demonstrated
his
greatest
priority
human
beings
thus
when
one
sees
a
little
bit
of
the
greater
picture
according
to
many
ancient
or
recent
eastern
and
western
commentators
confucius
teaching
can
be
considered
as
noteworthy
chinese
variant
of
humanism
confucius
also
heavily
emphasized
what
he
calls
rites
and
important
analects

the
people

the

is
averted
by

immediate
objective
is
to
force
other
people
to
act
as
if
their
basic
choice
rules
were
identical
to
those
of
the
coercing
party
however
this
mere
conformity
of
outward
behaviour
is
but
a
first
step
the
true
and
without
the
help
of
state
institutions
like
iceland
in
the
early
middle
ages
the
identification
between
state
and
law
is
but
a
special
normative
principle
introduced
by
public
roman
law
which
according
to
some
like
maitland
was
for
this
very
reason
to
be
treated
as
the
quintessential
law
of
tyranny

to
rely
on
any
evolutionary
process
do
not
share
the
whig
liberal
negative
view
of
the
social
effects
of
specific
coercion
they
often
opt
instead
for
a
so
called
social
engineering
approach
whereby
a
command
system
steered
by
a
few
competent
individuals
and
buttressed
up
by
quite
specific
coercion

the
term
celt
or
celtic
can
be
used
in
several
senses
it
can
denote
a
group
of
peoples
who
speak
or
descend
from
speakers
of
celtic
languages
or
the
people
of
prehistoric
and
early
historic
europe
who
share
common
cultural
traits
which
are
thought
to
that
given
the
fact
that
both
goidhels
and
brythonic
celts
spoke
related
languages
and
shared
many
cultural
social
and
religious
traits
many
going
very
deep
they
were
indeed
all
members
of
a
related
group
even
in
the
absence
of
early
recognition
of
the
fact
and
despite
the
linguistic
and
political
in
some
of
the
other
areas
one
current
school
of
thought
holds
that
celtic
language
and
culture
spread
to
those
areas
by
contact
rather
than
invasion
however
the
celtic
invasions
of
italy
greece
and
western
anatolia
are
well
documented
in
greek
and
latin
history
examine
the
map
of
celtic
landsfor
as
old
celtic
gods
took
on
new
latin
names
and
aspects
of
roman
divinities
and
began
to
be
worshipped
alongside
the
more
traditional
jovian
pantheon

john
locke
locke
s
major
works
a
letter
concerning
toleration
and
two
treatises
of
government
were
dictatorships
for
solutions
from
this
it
was
argued
that
the
state
had
the
duty
to
protect
the
economic
well
being
of
its
citizens
as
isaiah
berlin
said
freedom
for
the
wolves
means
death
for
the

this
growing
body
of
liberal
thought
argued
that

requires
a
government
to
act

consequences
of
an
inflatonary
policy

was
not
a

because
he
is
a
liberal
and
had
refused
to
give
up
that
label
in
the
united
states
the
term
liberal
had
changed
meaning
and
according
to
hayek
this
was
because
franklin
d
roosevelt
had
been
labeled
a
socialist
and
a

because
of

augustine
deems
this
scattering
important
because
he
believes
that
this
is
a
fulfillment
of
certain
prophecies
thus
proving
that
jesus
was

it
is
from
this
point
on
that
there
is
a

change
in

of

the

previously

the

moved

according
itself

thus
much
of
the
sensational
accusations
leveled
at
caligula
could
be
viewed
as
politically
motivated
attacks
against
his
character
and
his
memory
it
must
be
kept
in
mind
that
the
records
that
we
have
today
of
caligula
were
all
written
by
his
political
opponents
and
sufficient
to
express

clement
of
alexandria
titus
flavius
clemens
was
the
first
member
of
the
church
of
alexandria
to
be
more
than
a
name
and
one
of
its
most
distinguished
teachers
he
was
born
about
the
middle
of
the
two
nd
century
and
died
as
well
as
through
the
law
and
his
direct
revelation
in
the
gospel
to
communicate
the
truth
to
men
it
is
true
that
the
knowledge
of
the
philosophers
was
elementary
fragmentary
and
incapable
of
imparting
true
righteousness
and
it
was
far
surpassed
by
the
revelation
given
through
the
law
and
have
supreme
authority
for
him
for
the
other
new
testament
writings
he
seems
not
to
have
had
as
definite
a
line
of
demarcation
but
whatever
he
recognized
as
of
apostolic
origin
had
for
him
an
authority
distinct
from
and
higher
than
that
of
all
other
ecclesiastical
tradition
an
excerpt
from
property
of
the
meditator
descartes
does
not
make
use
of
this
defence
however
as
we
have
already
seen
he
responds
to
the
criticism
by
conceding
that
there
would
indeed
be
an
extra
premise
needed
but
denying
that
the
cogito
is
a
syllogism
perhaps
a
more
relevant
contention
is
whether
the

many
scientists
had

but
none
had

for
two
reasons
the
knowledge
of

required
was
insufficient
at
the
time
and
coca
does
not
grow
in
crazed
negro
brain
mass

manufactured
an
epidemic
of
cocaine
use
amongst
african
americans
in
the
southern

to
play
upon
racial
prejudices
of
the
era
although
there
is
little
evidence
that
such
an

actually
took

water
when

rock
is
heated
this
water
boils
making
a

sound
hence
the

crack
baking
from
the
toxic
effects
of
cocaine
there
is
also
danger
of
circulatory
emboli
from
the
insoluble
substances
that
may
be
used
to
cut
the

obviously
there
is
also
a
risk

associated
with
the
use

an

mixture
of
cocaine
and
heroin
known
as
novocaine
it
acts

the
locomotor
enhancing
properties
of
cocaine
may
be
attributable
to
its
enhancement
of
dopaminergic
transmission
from
the
substantia
nigra
recent
research
points
to
an
important
role
of
circadian
mechanisms
and
clock
genes
in
behavioral
actions
of
cocaine
since
nicotine
increases
the
levels
of
leaves

then
needs
to
be
strained
the
alkaloids
should
be
extracted
from

then

again
potassium
permanganate
is
usually
added
then
the

subscribe

the
principle
that

result

the
general
chiropractic
belief
that
healthcare
interventions
should
consider
the
person
as
a
whole
and
that
conservative
non
invasive
treatment
approaches
should
be
used
where
possible

and
therefore
providing

dialogue
between

systems

hume

to

something
unreasonable
about
it

hume
denied
that
reason
has
any

after
all

is
just
a

it
was
his

francis

coined
the
utilitarian
slogan

it

leaps

in

many

there

often
the

is
made
thicker
or
the

increased
neither
of
these
tactics
make
the

appear

and
accept
lesser
proportions

to
avoid

types

a
diode
is
a
component
that
restricts
the
direction
of
movement
of
charge
carriers
it
allows
an
electric
current
to
flow
in
one
direction
but
essentially
blocks
it
in
diodes
like
the
avalanche
or
zener
diodes
the
concept
of
piv
is
not
applicable
since
they
have
a
deliberate
breakdown
beyond
a
known
reverse
current
such
that
the
reverse
voltage
is
clamped
to
a
known
value
called
zener
voltage
the
devices
however
have
a
maximum
limit
to
the
current

simply
counsel

the

leads
to
circular
claims
that
no

are
required

the

wanted
the

to
avoid
the
unsettling
form
of
the
daleks
coupled
with
their
rights
to
them
with
the
bbc
therefore
had
the
problem
of
owning
a
money
making
concept
that
proved
nearly
impossible
to
sell
to
anyone
else
and
was
dependent
on
the
bbc
wanting
to
produce
stories
featuring
the
creatures
indeed

attempts
to
market
the

who
were

at
the

of

be
geographic
isolation
which
may
in
turn
lead
to

isolation
or

populations
may
also
shrink

grow
over

respectively
since

size
has
a

effect

at

the

in

in

wished

easter
is
that
it
was
calcuated
by
the
moon
and
could
fall
on
any
day
of
the
week
middle
ages
this
practice
was
more
succinctly
phrased
as
easter
is
observed
on
the
sunday
after
the
first
full
moon
on
or
after
the
day
of
the
vernal
equinox
this
full

the
church

used
its
own
methods
to
determine
easter
until
gospel

sermon
may

preached

the

was

doing

the

be

at

as
they
were
celebrated
in

otherwise

this

they
are
competitive
periodic

definitive
elections
in
which
the
chief
decision
makers
in

subject
until
a

is
reached
the
consensus
requirement
means
that
discussions
can
go
on
for

very
long

the
result
will
be
that
only
those
who
are
genuinely
interested
will
participate

therefore

claude

introduced
the
very

concept

one
nine
four
eight
the
view
of
seeing
entropy
in
statistical
mechanics
point
in
the
cycle
entropy
as
a
state
function
we
can
now
deduce
an
important
fact
about
the
entropy
change
during
any
thermodynamic
transformation
not
just
a
cycle
first
consider
a
reversible
transformation
that
brings
a
system
from
an
equilibrium
state
a
to
another
equilibrium
state
b
if
we
follow
the
given
system
for
a
quantum
system
with
a
discrete
set
of
microstates
if
e
i
is
the
energy
of
microstate
i
and
p
i
is
its
probability
that
it
occurs
during
the
system
s
fluctuations
then
the
entropy
of
the
system
is
s
k
b
sum
i
p
i
second
law
of
thermodynamics
we
can
view
as
a
measure
of
the
disorder
in
a
system
this
is
reasonable
because
what
we
think
of
as
ordered
systems
tend
to
have
very
few
configurational
possibilities
and
disordered
systems
have
very
many
as
an
illustration
of
this
idea
consider
a
set
of
does
not
have
rotational
or
vibrational
energy
this
means
that
there
is
only
one
way
in
which
this
order
can
be
attained
when
every
particle
of
the
structure
is
in
its
proper
place
however
the
equation
for
predicting
quantized
vibrational
levels
shows
that
even
when
the
vibrational
quantum
number
is
can
be
considered
to
have
increasing
entropy
then
as
roger
penrose
has
pointed
out
an
important
role
in
the
disordering
process
is
played
by
gravity
which
causes
dispersed

but
almost
all
his
participation
in
humanity
human
nature
was
re
created
allowing
human
beings
to
participate
in
the
divine
nature
the
word
of

came
in
his
own
person
because
it
was
he

of
the
father
who
could
recreate
man
made
after
the
image
in
order
to
effect
this
on
the
path
towards
god
a
traditional
practice
of
orthodox
is
to
have
a
spiritual
father
or
mother
to
whom
one
confesses
and
who
treats
the
sin
on
an
individual
basis
an
experienced
spiritual
father
will
know
how
and
when
to
apply
strictness
in
dealing
with
sin
and
when
to
literal
terms
as
a
real
historical
event
jesus
christ
the
son
of
god
was
crucified
and
died
descended
into
hades
rescued
all
the
souls
held
there
through
man
s
original
sin
and
then
because
hades
could
not
restrain
the
infinite
god
rose
from
the
dead
thus
saving
all
mankind
through
the
symbolic
layout
of
the
church
remains
the
same
the
church
building
is
divided
into
three
main
parts
the
narthex
entrance
hall
the
nave
and
the
sanctuary
also
called
the
altar
or
holy
place
narthex
the
narthex
is
the
connection
between
the
church
and
the
outside
world
and
for
this
been
a
strong
trend
of
returning
to
the
more
traditional
and
symbolic
representations
statuary
is
almost
non
existant
within
the
orthodox
church
possibly
because
it
too
closely
resembles
the
previous
pagan
greek
age
of
idol
worship
and
also
because
icons
are
designed
to
capture
the
spiritual
aspects
of
christ
and
hold
a
very
special
and
important
place
in
the
church
this
kind
of
life
is
often
seen
as
incompatible
with
any
kind
of
worldly
activity
including
that
which
is
normally
regarded
as
virtuous
social
work
schoolteaching
and
other
such
work
is
therefore
usually
left
to
laypeople
the
schema
worn
by
some
level
of
strictness
it
is
considered
a
greater
sin
to
advertise
one
s
fasting
than
to
not
participate
in
the
fast
fasting
is
a
purely
personal
communication
between
the
orthodox
and
god
and
in
fact
has
no
place
whatsoever
in
the
public
life
of
the
orthodox
church
if
one
and
the
crowning
the
betrothal
includes
the
exchange
of
the
rings
the
procession
the
declaration
of
intent
and
the
lighting
of
candles
then
follows
the
crowning
the
epistle
the

aside

the
sound
is
generated
by

and
not

the
embouchure
is
therefore
based
on
sealing

churches
and

were
often
called
evangelical
in
contrast
to

liberalism
the
term
evangelical
in
a
lexical
but
less
commonly
used
sense
refers
to
anything
implied
in
the
belief
that
jesus
is
the

the

word

hundred
christians
from

countries
met
in
london
and
set
up
the
evangelical
alliance
they
saw
this
as
a
new
thing
however
they
saw
the
fundamentalists
separatism
and
rejection
of
the
social
gospel
as
an
over
reaction
they
charged
the
modernists
with
having
lost
their
identity
as
evangelicals
and
attacked
the
fundamentalists
as
having
lost
the
christ
like

they
argued
that

this
also

nietzsche
had
met
richard
wagner
in

and
sometime
later
his
wife
cosima
nietzsche
admired
both
greatly
and
during
his
time
at
basel
and
plagued
by
suicidal
thoughts
he
fled
to
rapallo
where
in
only
ten
days
he
wrote

first

severing
philosophical
ties

nehemas
shows
that
this
interpretation
is
totally
independent
of
physics
and
does
not
presuppose
the
truth
of
cosmology
nehamas
interpretation
is
that
ancient
rome
nietzsche
was
concerned
with
the
state
of
european
culture
during
his
lifetime
and
therefore
focused
much
of
his
analysis
on
the
history
of
master
and
slave
morality
within
europe
occasional
references
however
also
suggest
that
he
meant
these
terms
to
be
applied
to
other
societies
however
as
with
a
dying
body
will
have
to
be
an
incarnate
will
to
power
it
will
strive
to
grow
spread
seize
become
predominant
not
from
any
morality
or
immorality
but
because
it
is
living
and
because
life
simply
is
will

power
exploitation
belongs

the
essence
of
what
lives
as
a
when
it
is
actually
described
as
a
tragic
lament
by
the
character
zarathustra
god
is
dead
is
more
of
an
observation
than
a
declaration
nietzsche
did
not
advance
arguments
for
atheism
but
merely
observed
that
for
all
practical
purposes
his
contemporaries
lived
as
if
god
were
dead
nietzsche
believed
this
between
the
sexes
as
seen
by
nietzsche
can
be
seen
clearest
in
the
following
aphorism
when
a
woman
has
scholarly
inclinations
there
is
generally
something
wrong
with
her
sexual
nature
barrenness
itself
conduces

resoundingly

candidate
it
is
often
claimed
that
because
each

district
votes
for
its
own

the
elected
candidate
is
held
accountable
to
his
own
voters
thereby
helping
to
prevent
incompetent

system
is
that
invariably
voters
can
select
only
one
candidate
in
a
single
member
district
whilst
in
multi
member
districts
they
can
never
select
more
candidates
than
the
number
of
seats
in
the
district
some
argue
that
fptp
would
work
better
if
electors
could
cast
votes
for
as
many
choice
but
to
vote
for
them
the
likely
result
of
this
is
that
candidates
will
less
closely
reflect
the
viewpoints
of
those
who
vote
for
them
it
may
also
be
argued
that
one

electromagnetism

the

the

one
of
the

effects
of

is
that
it

two
protons
together
in
the
helium
nucleus
despite
their
tremendous
electric
repulsion
the
quantum
theory
of
the

is
called
quantum

or
qcd

the
four
freedoms
are
goals
famously
articulated
by
theory
and
it
is
generally
accepted
that
all
of
classical
mathematics
can
be
formalized
in
zfc
there
are
other
theories
that
are
commonly
formalized
independently
in
first
order
logic
though
they
do
admit
implementation
in
set
theory
such
as
peano
arithmetic
defining
first
order
logic
a
predicate
calculus
consists
of
forall
x
varphi
and
exists
x
varphi
are
wff
s
and
similarly
for
any
other
variable
in
place
of
x
its
free
variables
are
the
free
variables
of
or
other
than
x
any
instance
of
x
or
other
variable
replacing
x
in
this
construction
is
said
to
be
bound
not
quantifiers
qx
with
meanings
such
as
there
are
many
x
such
that
most
of
these
logics
are
in
some
sense
extensions
of
first
order
logic
they
include
all
the
quantifiers
and
logical
operators
of
first
order
logic
with
the
same
meanings
lindstrom
showed
first
order
logic
has
no
extensions
other
compatible
with
the
homotopy
equivalence
relation
and
the
composition
of
loops
and
we
get
a
group
homomorphism
from
x
x
zero
to
y
y
zero
we
thus
obtain
a
functor
from
the
category
of
pointed
topological
spaces
to
the
category
of
groups
in
the
category
of
topological
spaces
without
distinguished
called
a
functor
category
morphisms
in
this
category
are
natural
transformations
between
functors
functors
are
often
defined
by
universal
properties
examples
are
the
tensor

direct

a

delineates
a
usually
infinite
set
of

length
strings
over
a

formal
grammars
are
so
named
by
analogy
to
grammar
in
two
restricted
types
of

are
most
often
used
because

freenet
has
been
extensively
reported
on
in
the
press
albeit
primarily
due
to
its
implications
for

than
for
its
wider
aim
of
freedom
of

been
developed
via
a

during
the
memorial
service
according
to
most
religions
coffins
are
kept
closed
during
the
burial
ceremony
in
eastern
orthodox
funerals
the
coffins
are
reopened
just
before
burial
to

ones
to
look
at
the
deceased
one
last
and
words
to
avoid
the
likelihood
of
the
name
being

in

speech
or
writing
the
new
names
are
typically
chosen
by
a
buddhist
priest
after
consulting
the
family
of
the
deceased
the
new
name
bestowed
upon
them
is
the
name
they
will
have
in
the
afterlife
where

tombs

other

this

estate

while
the

the

as

discipline
during
this
period
boas
made
five
more
trips
to
the
pacific
northwest
his
continuing
field
research
led
him
to
think
of
culture
as
a
local
context
for
human
action
his
emphasis
on
local
context
and
history
led
him
to
oppose
the
dominant
model
at
into
one
department
but
as
reconceiving
anthropology
through
the
integration
of
different
objects
of
anthropological
research
into
one
over
arching
object
was
one
of
boas
s
fundamental
contributions
to
the
discipline
and
came
to
characterize
american
anthropology
against
that
of
england
france
or
germany
this
approach
defines
as
its
object
which
is
expressed
through
change
over
time
this
work
was
central
to
his
influential
argument
that
differences
between
races
were
not
immutable
these
findings
were
radical
at
the
time
and
continue
to
be
debated
in
two

the
anthropologists
corey

sparks
and
richard

jantz
claimed
that
not
recognized
in
their

in

words
people
recognize
differences
in
pronunciations
rather
it
is
that
sounds
are
classified
according

their
similarity
in

that
people
classify
a
variety
of
perceived
sounds
into

would

opinion
and
of

that
occur
in
primitive
society
and
which
are
the
causes
of
far
reaching
changes
boas
argued
that
attention
to
individual
agency
reveals
that
the
activities
of
the
individual
are
determined
to
a
great
extent
by
his
social
environment
but
in
turn
his
own
activities
american
negro
his
uncontrollable
emotions
his
lack

are

inherent
your
work
would
still

one
he
then
went
on
however
to
argue
against
this
view
to
the
claim
that

civilizations
are
at
the
time
more
advanced
than

societies
a

still

from

using

the

is
which
would
be

in

point
in

per
unit

it

actually
equal
to

at

galileo
was
home
schooled
at
a
very
young
age
after
that
he
attended
the
university
this
led
him
to
the
conclusion
that
the
moon
was
rough
and
uneven
and
just
like
the
surface
of
the
earth
itself
and
not
a
perfect
sphere
as
aristotle
had
claimed
galileo
observed
the
milky
way
previously
believed
to
be
nebulous
and
found
it
to
be
a
multitude
of
stars
a
few
yards
apart
while
he
could
reach
no
conclusion
on
whether
light
propagated
instantaneously
he
recognized
that
the
distance
between
the
hilltops
was
perhaps
too
small
for
a
good
measurement
galileo
is
lesser
known
for
yet
still
credited
with
being
one
of
the
first
to
understand
sound
frequency
after
an
order
not
to
hold
or
defend
the
idea
that
the
earth
moves
and
the
sun
stands
still
at
the
centre
the
decree
did
not
prevent
galileo
from
hypothesizing
heliocentrism
for
the
next
several
years
galileo
stayed
well
away
from
the
controversy

that

this
presented
a
problem

was

which

finally
though

from

in

such
references
in

music
and

were
originally
tongue
in

but
as
time
went
on
bands
and
members

the
subculture
took
the
connection
more
seriously
as
a
result
morbid
supernatural
and
occult
themes
became
a
more
noticeably
serious

by
some
older
goths
to
refer
to

as

in

morbid
imagery

moods

clearly
lies
in
this
tradition
defining
a
philosophy
of

subculture
is
difficult
because
of
the
overwhelming
importance

mood
for
those
involved
balancing

that

his

dissertation
in

of
this

this
work
saw
the
emergence
of
several
central
themes
of
his
mature
work

the
distinction
between
the
faculties
of
intellectual
thought
only
upon
things
about
which
reason
can
tell
us
and
not
deriving
any
principles
from

conclusions

are
able
to
be
applied
the
world
of
experience
in
the
second
part
of
the
metaphysic
of
morals
kant
is
known
for
his
theory
that
there
is
a
single
moral
earth
even
though
in
reality
the
earth
revolves
around
the
sun
taking
the
observer
s

prevents
the

projection
of

critique
overview
the
purposes
of
laws
dealing
with
exclusive
rights
over
intangible
subject
matter
or
the
product
of
intellectual
or
creative
endeavor
have
varied
but
they
all
share
in
common
the
appearance
of
granting
the
owner
of
the
that
exclusive
rights
are
a
government
grant
rather
than
a
fundamental
right
held
by
citizens
though
it
is
convenient
for
direct
incentive
beneficiaries
to
regard
exclusive
rights
as
akin
to
property

in
controversy
over

some
consider
that
the
expansion
of

laws
upsets
the
balance
between
encouraging
and
facilitating
creativity
and
innovation
and
the
dissemination
of
new
ideas
and
creations
into
the
public
domain
for
the
common
good
they
consider
that

an

the

the

it

one
one

five
that
the
cult
of
the
icon
became
widespread
in

byzantine
world
partly
on
account
of
the
dearth
of
richer
materials
such
as
mosaics
ivory
and
enamels
but
also
because
a
special
screen
for
icons
the
earlier
councils
and
in
setting
forth
the
role
of
images
icons
in
the
lives
of
the
faithful
reaffirms
the
reality
of
the
incarnation
of
the
eternal
word
of
god
when
it
states
the
more
frequently
christ

the
mother

the
more
are
of
christ
the
holy
mother
of
god
and
the
saints
and
is
the
defender
of
the
devil
and
his
demons
this
is
because
the
theology
behind
icons
is
closely
tied
to
the
incarnational
theology
of
the
humanity
and
divinity
of
jesus
so
that
attacks
on
icons
typically
have
the
effect
the
lack

in

some

have
recently
argued
that
international
law
has
evolved
to
a
point
where
it
exists
separately
from
the

there
is

toward

of

to
recommend
pacific
resolution
of
disputes
such

are
not
binding
under
international

though
they
usually
are
expressive
of
the
council
s
convictions
in
rare
cases
the

international

distinguished

the

of

conducted
by

john
major
s
appearance
was
noted

prodigious
philtrum

large

all
of
which
were
exaggerated
in

in

given

a

words

emigrating

returning

in

seven

he
was
ordained
by
bishop
paulinus
apparently
with
some
unwillingness
and
on
condition
that
he
still
continue
his
ascetic
life
soon
afterward
he
went
to
constantinople
to
pursue
his
study
of
scripture
after
the
manner
of
philo
and
the
alexandrian
school
but
he
deserves
credit
for
the
distinctness
with
which
he
emphasizes
the
difference
between
the
old
testament
apocrypha
and
the
hebraica
veritas
of
the
canonical
books
cf
his

people
and
their
customs
an
argument
that
has
recurred
ever
since
including
recently
in
the
work
of
jared
diamond
he
argued
that
laws
could
not
be
created
by
pure
rationalism
since
geography
and
history
shaped
habits
and
patterns
this
stood
in
sharp
contrast
to
the
prevailing
enlightenment
view
that
reason
foregoes
the
mechanistic
views
that
contemporaneous
science
subsumed
during
his
time
therewith
denying
rationality
s
superiority
as
the
sole
interpretation
of
reality
furthermore
he
declares
that
all
knowledge
is
related
to
humanity
through
its
functional
value
alone
and
that
knowledge
presupposes
a
perspectival
quality

an

manuscript
by
haydn
in
the

from
a
biography
of
haydn
available
from

works
haydn
is
often
described
as
the
father
of
the
classical
symphony
and
string
quartet
in
fact
the
he
revived
and
intensified
haydn
s
practice
joining
the
musical
structure
to
tight
small
motifs
often
by
gradually
reshaping
both
the
work
and
the
motifs
so
that
they
fit
quite
carefully
the
emotional
content
of
haydn
s
music
cannot
accurately
be
summarised
in
words
but
one
may
attempt
an
approximate
s
popular
style
can
be
heard
in
virtually
all
of
his
later
work
including
the
twelve
london
symphonies
the
late
quartets
and
piano
trios
and
the
two
late
oratorios
the
return

marked
the
last

in
haydn

employed
techniques
such
as
feedback

hendrix
was
able
to
exploit
them
to
a
previously
undreamed
of

spot
was

as
a

musician
he
was
proficient
on
several
instruments
but
found
employment
mostly
as
a
horn
player
and
double
bassist
he
married
christiane
nissen
a
seamstress
and
he
never
engaged
in
public
polemics
again
it
was
the
premiere
of
ein

his
largest
choral
work
in
bremen
in

that
confirmed
brahms
s

reputation
and
led
many
to

that
he
had

him
to

another
factor
that
contributed
to

was
that

others
however
denounce
this

arguing
that
islam
lacks
basic
features
in

that
judaism

also
because

had
discovered
a

another
young
hegelian
max
stirner
applied
hegelian
criticism

argued
that
stopping
anywhere

of
nihilistic
egoism
was
mysticism
his
views
were
not
accepted
by
most
of

nevertheless
stirner
s
book
was
the
main
reason
marx
abandoned
the
feuerbachian
view
and
developed
the
basic
concept
of
historical
materialism
the
most
important
political
event
during
the
existence
of
the
international
was
the
paris
commune
of
one
eight
seven
one
when
the
citizens
of
paris
rebelled
against
their
government
and
held
the
city
for
two
months
on
the
bloody
suppression
of
this
rebellion
marx
wrote
one
of
his
most
famous
for
marx
was
before
all
else
a
revolutionist
his
real
mission
in
life
was
to
contribute
in
one
way
or
another
to
the
overthrow
of
capitalist
society
and
of
the
state
institutions
which
it
had
brought
into
being
to
contribute
to
the
liberation
of
the
modern
proletariat
which
he
was
is
a
natural
capacity
for
a
physical
activity
but
it
is
intimately
tied
to
the
human
mind
and
human
imagination
a
spider
conducts
operations
that
resemble
those
of
a
weaver
and
a
bee
puts
to
shame
many
an
architect
in
the
construction
of
her
cells
but
what
distinguishes
the
worst
a
commodity
when
peasants
became
free
to
sell
their
own
labor
power
and
needed
to
do
so
because
they
no
longer
possessed
their
own
land
or
tools
necessary
to
produce
people
sell
their
labor
power
when
they
accept
compensation
in
return
for
whatever
work
they
do
in
a
given
period
because
too
many
non
jews
benefit
from
or
are
invested
in
capitalism
to
attack
capitalism
directly
marx
also
uses
this
rhetoric
ironically
to
develop
his
critique
of
bourgeois
notions
of
emancipation
marx
points
out
that
the
bourgeois
notion
of
freedom
is
predicated
on
choice
in
politics
through
elections
in
the
stalinism
and
fascism
they
had
grave
doubts
as
to
the
traditional
marxist
concept
of
proletarian
class
consciousness
second
unlike
earlier
marxists
especially
lenin
they
rejected
economic
determinism
while
highly
influential
their
work
has
been
criticized
by
both
orthodox
marxists
and
some
marxists
involved
in
political
practice
for
divorcing
marxist
theory
like
the
united
states
much
as
marx
described
marxist
political
parties
and
movements
have
significantly
declined
since
the
fall
of
the
soviet
union
critics
argue
that
the
soviet
union
s
numerous
internal
failings
and
subsequent
collapse
were
a
direct
result
of
the
practical
failings
of
marxism
but
many
past

borrow
the
characters
from
the

the

for
purposes
of

greece
and
italy
were
strongly
opposed
to
the
whole
idea
and
there
was
vigorous
opposition
to
military
action
in
every
nato
country
consequently
when
the
talks
failed
to
achieve
an
agreement
by
the
original
deadline
of
one
nine
the
military
part
of
the
agreement
was
offered
only
at
the
very
end
of
the
talks
without
much
possibility
for
negotiation
and
because
the
other
side
condemned
in
harshest
terms
as
a
separatist
terrorist
delegation
completely
refused
to
meet
delegation
of

negotiate
directly
during
the
rambouillet
talks
at

and
a
further
wave
of
refugees
could
have
dangerously
destabilised

it
is
arguable
that
the
war
in
kosovo
was
not
initially
in
the
direct
interests
of
the
nato
states
but
the
refugee
crisis
made
it

supporting

on

grounds
there
was
however
criticism
from
all
parts
of
the
political
spectrum
for
the
way
that
nato
conducted
the
campaign
nato
officials
sought
to
portray
it
as
a
clean
war
using
precision
weapons
the
us
department
of
defense
claimed
that
up
to
a
diplomatic
peace
effort
clinton

state
department
also
claimed
serbian
troops
had
committed

the
new

reported
the
administration
said
evidence
of
genocide
by
serbian
forces
was
growing
to
include
abhorrent
and
criminal
action
on
a
vast
scale
the
language
was
the
state
department

strongest
yet
teams
were
unable
to
verify
more
than
a

and
some
of

appeared
